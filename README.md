# THE SPARK FOUNDATION TASKS
Here I have uploaded all my internship tasks that were assigned to me. I have also added the description of each task for your reference.

I have installed anaconda in my system. You can refer this Youtube video- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQWAiUhZJX8 for Windows anaconda installation.  

After that I installed Jupyter Notebook for python and ML programming which can be easily done after conda installation.  

Most importantly, you must have Python 3.0 or any latest python module. Here is the link - https://www.python.org/downloads/  


TASK 1 ------ # SUPERVISED LEARNING - LINEAR REGRESSION

In this piece, I am going to introduce the Linear Regression Model. Our problem is about predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied.

To download the IRIS dataset used in my program- http://bit.ly/w-data . You can add more data in this file for better training, but keep it in mind that it doesn't led to overftting.


TASK 2 ------ # UNSUPERVISED LEARNING - kMEANS CLUSTERING

The most common and simplest clustering algorithm out there is the K-Means clustering. This algorithms involve you telling the algorithms how many possible cluster (or K) there are in the dataset. The algorithm then iteratively moves the k-centers and selects the datapoints that are closest to that centroid in the cluster.

In this, We need to predict the optimum number of clusters from IRIS data set and visualize it. Letâ€™s start to code our model step by step. You can see sufficient information in the comment lines of the code.

TASK 3 ----- # DECISION TREE ALGORITHM. 

I am going to introduce the Decision Tree Classifier Model. I have used IRIS data in this model. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
