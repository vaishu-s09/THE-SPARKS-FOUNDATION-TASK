# THE SPARK FOUNDATION TASKS
Here I have uploaded all my internship tasks that were assigned to me. I have also added the description of each task for your reference.

I have installed anaconda in my system. You can refer this Youtube video- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQWAiUhZJX8 for Windows anaconda installation.  

After that I installed Jupyter Notebook for python and ML programming which can be easily done after conda installation.  

Most importantly, you must have Python 3.0 or any latest python module. Here is the link - https://www.python.org/downloads/  

TASK 2------- # UnsupervisedClustering (kMeans)

The most common and simplest clustering algorithm out there is the K-Means clustering. This algorithms involve you telling the algorithms how many possible cluster (or K) there are in the dataset. The algorithm then iteratively moves the k-centers and selects the datapoints that are closest to that centroid in the cluster.

In this, We need to predict the optimum number of clusters from IRIS data set and visualize it. Letâ€™s start to code our model step by step. You can see sufficient information in the comment lines of the code.

To download the IRIS dataset used in my program- https://drive.google.com/file/d/11Iq7YvbWZbt8VXjfm06brx66b10YiwK-/view . You can also download it from Kaggle website.
